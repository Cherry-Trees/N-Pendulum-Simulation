# Description

An n-pendulum simulation written in Python 3 that utilizes Scipy's odeint function for integration and Matplotlib for visualization. The program solves a set of n second-order differential equations derived from the Lagrangian formulation of an n-pendulum system.

# Examples

### Standard Double Pendulum

A double pendulum (n=2) with both masses 1 and rod lengths 1, with initial conditions angle1=90deg and angle2=90deg, yields the following results:
